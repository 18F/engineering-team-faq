### For engineering team members:

##### What is expected of me regarding time tracking/how I spend my time?
All 18F staff track their time in Tock. Time sheets for the previous week are due at the end of the day (COB in your time zone) each Monday. For more information on how to use Tock, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBbbgzTE5MqHQrDmhuGGU-eMbAnYYHghLhTvdXYPmxw/edit#heading=h.lk2osj11bxao 

Engineering team members are expected to, on the whole, meet their project commitments. Beyond this, team members don’t need to be concerned with billable vs. non-billable hours.

We recognize that both client and internal work provide value. Engineering team members are encouraged to participate in guilds, working groups, and other organization-building initiatives.

The ratio of project to non-project work will vary for each individual, and it will fluctuate over time. You should have some time after project work to spend on working groups and the like, if you are interested. If you feel that you cannot afford to take the time to work on these initiatives, there are likely larger issues with your billable project — for example, it might be understaffed. Please work with your project lead(s), your facilitator, or the Director of Engineering to rectify those issues. Being agile, we aim to work at a cadence that can be maintained indefinitely. 


##### Someone made me think I should be concerned about billability —what do I do?
Tell your facilitator and the Director of Engineering. Chances are, the person was only trying to be helpful and there's nothing for you to be concerned about, but anytime a team member says something that seems to contradict any of the above, we’d like to know so we can make sure everyone is on the same page.


##### I’m interested in working on a different or additional project. How can I do that?
Talk to your facilitator, one of the functional leads, or the Director of Engineering. We do everything we can to make sure that you can work on the things that you’re excited about.


##### How do I learn about what other projects are available for me to work on?
Unfortunately, there’s not a very good way for you to do this right now. However, you have a few options. These include: 
Going to the Thursday Project Intake stand ups, or scanning the agenda for the past few meetings to see what is in the works. You can find the Weekly Intake Standup on the 18F Events calendar.
Talk to your facilitator, one of the functional leads, or the director about what teams currently need help (or might need help in the near future).
Take a look at Open Opportunities.
If there is a specific subject area you are interested in, or a language/stack you want to gain experience with, let your facilitator or the director know so they can factor this into staffing decisions.

In the future, we will be able to see current projects and the team members on them via the Team API and the Hub.


##### How can I participate in project intake tech evals?
Talk to your facilitator or the Engineering Director and they will get you into the rotation.


##### How can I participate in resume review and candidate interviewing?
Reach out to your Facilitator, who will connect you with #talent.


##### How can I find out what kinds of projects we want to pursue as an organization?
Up until now, 18F hasn’t had a list of priority projects it wants to pursue. There is a working group focused on our priorities. They are working on a framework document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eb8I5_sHYYGTUmV6XxrdrszNwgR3_LHmcnAGGAtdSXs/edit 
You can find the group in #wg-priorities.


##### I have an idea for a project we should pursue. How do I propose it?
Bring it up to your facilitator or the Director of Engineering. We don’t have a formal process for this yet, but they will see what they can do. You can also drop into #seeds to learn about funding options.


##### Who should I submit my leave requests to in ALOHA? I don’t see Holly available.
For the time being, please submit leave requests to Eric Maland. Once Holly gets FEDdesk access, and it becomes possible to submit requests to her in ALOHA, please do so.
