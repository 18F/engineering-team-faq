### For other 18F staff:

##### I’d like clarification on how an engineer spent time logged in Tock.
##### I’d like to ask an engineer to decrease or increase their billable hours.
##### I’d like to ask an engineer to decrease or increase the time they’re spending on a project.
##### I’m concerned about an engineer’s number of billable hours.
##### I’m concerned about the billable hours of the engineering team overall.
Hi there: We’re glad you’re interested in learning more about the goings-on of the engineering team. If you have questions about an engineer’s work hours (past or current), or about the billability of the engineering team in general, please reach out to the Director of Engineering. They’ll be glad to have a conversation with you and get you the information you need. 

One of our goals is to maintain a culture that is low stress and supports important projects — be they internal, external, billable, or non-. Our engineers have different contexts for thinking about billability; more often than not, the topic is a source of stress. We believe that a healthy and productive culture keeps all concerns about billed hours at the supervisory level.


##### I found a mistake on an engineer’s timesheet.
If you notice a time-tracking mistake, please feel free to get in touch with the engineer directly.


#####  How do I request developers to work on a project team?
This may change soon, but for the moment, write up an Open Opportunity with a tag of “18F” (examples).
